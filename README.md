# dataScienceFinalProject

- This is the repository for the final deliverable of my Intro to Data Science class with Professor Nicholas Mattei of Tulane University in the Fall 2021 semester. 
- The website associated with this repository is https://bennettkahn.github.io/dataScienceFinalProject/
- For this project, my partner Ila Keshishian and I used web scraping techniques to collect, organize, clean, and analyze Orleans Parish Magistrate Court Dockets.
  - While this data is publicly available, its original form is very messy--one webpage per docket (and the entirety of the docket in one HTML text element)--and, hence, impossible to analyze.
